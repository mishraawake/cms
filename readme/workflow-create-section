For creating a section we need following component.

One front-end template that will display the fields used to get information for the section.

 -- For that we need a definition of the section object.

 [template generator] * (definition) = template

 -- For definition we need DefDao -- get definition

 -- A server end point that will receive definition-identity of section and generate view information
 according to the configuration.

 One javascript component that will generate form according to the definition object that it receives.

 So template can be generated by two process.

 Server side

 Front end side.

 We need to have in place the verifier component that will verify the section object. That in turn uses
 definition object.


 Variation - update the definition object.
 Change the type of field of definition object.

 Helper data for the section object.

 Business process for the section object.

 Bifurcating and aggregating section object.

 Online feedback of form for the auto suggest etc..
