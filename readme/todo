--- finished .. please see file named *modeling..Fix name space standardization and internal node hierarchy arrangement.
-- We have a problem when enabling permission. Some user can have permission for the hierarchy of items but he/she
may not have permission for definition and hence he can not create item because for item creation , one must have
access to definition. Either we have to club our permission in such a way that these things will be enabled together
for the user ... solution required....

--- Please take care of threading while implementing runtime context where user is kept. We need to find
better mechanism.

--- Need to handle cases where hierarchical definition required. For example in case of a poll , we need to create
definition for the question and answer. -- continuation.. we have defined hierarchy but we are not making measures
for referring definition objects. This is of future scope that we will handle later.


-- Association should be independent of item.. perhaps.

-- Exception framework needs to be work on.
